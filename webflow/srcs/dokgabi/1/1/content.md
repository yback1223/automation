Origin of Dokkaebi

Dokkaebi's origin is known as a folktale of the Silla period, and it is known that it is a miscellaneous ghost in the shape of an animal or person that has been passed down in Korea, and comes from objects that people have used in their daily lives, such as old brooms and old furniture.

Dokkaebi (Korean Goblin) is a hornless, large, hairy and is wearing traditional trouser jeogori, and also known as a grateful person who brings wealth to people or a friendly personality who likes to play.

Dokkaebi has a divine power, but unlike ghosts, she helps by staying close to people and helping them. Dokkaebi also punishes and punishes a liar or a greedy person, but it does not hurt a good person. So, Koreans heard that if they don't listen to their parents in their childhood, goblins will catch children, and if they listen to their parents well, goblins will give them gold and silver treasures in front of their house.

Dokkaebi not only likes to eat, drink, dance, and play loudly, but also blesses poor but good people and acts as lovers of old bachelor or widow, bringing them wealth or setting up a good place to live a good life. They use their divine power to let go of their legs or prevent beams (洑). However, those who lie, those who are not loyal, and those who are greedy are punished. This can be said to be the image of Korean inner consciousness via Dokkaebi.
